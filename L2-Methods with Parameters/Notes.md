# Unit 2 - Methods

## <u>Methods With Parameters</u>

### Method Definition

A method is a block of code which executes or completes a single task. Methods are typically smaller processes of a larger task. If you are trying to drive a car, you might have a method which accelerates the car, stops the car and turns the car.

Look at [MethodExample][sandbox]. In this example, we are using methods to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle.

Each method has two parts, first the [method declaration](), lines `10` and `18`, and the [method call](), lines `6`and `7`. 

### Method Declaration

The method declaration includes the method header, which we will discuss in more depth in the next lessons. For now, start every method just as you would the `main` method.

### Method Call

Once you've written a method, you must _CALL_, or invoke the method. This is simply just running the method, using its identifier, inside the main method.
