        You run a very successful Lemonade Stand.

        You sell 16 oz. cups of lemonade for $0.50 and
        20 oz. cups of lemonade for $0.99.

        You also have to report your income to the IRS,

        Create a program which will ask the number of 16oz and 20oz cups of lemonade and display the total cost with tax.
